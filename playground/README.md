# Playground Folder

Welcome to the **Playground folder**! Here, you will find a collection of JavaScript files where I've performed various tests and practices to enhance my skills and understanding of the language.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this folder is to provide a safe space for experimentation and practice. I use this playground to explore different JavaScript concepts, try out new code snippets, and gain hands-on experience.

## Learning and Growth

The playground plays a vital role in my learning journey. By continuously experimenting and practicing, I strive to improve my coding skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in JavaScript development.

Feel free to explore the files and witness my progress as a JavaScript developer. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
