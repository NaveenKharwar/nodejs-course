# Node.js Terminal-Based Weather App

## Description

This is a simple Node.js terminal-based weather app that allows users to get weather information for a specific location. The app takes a location as an argument and provides real-time weather data for that location.

## How to Use

To use the weather app, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js on your system if you haven't already. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal (command prompt or shell) in the project's root directory.

4. Run the app using the following command format:

```
node app [location]
```

Replace `[location]` with the name of the place whose weather information you want to retrieve. For example:

```
node app Kanpur
```

## Example Output

Running the app with a specific location will provide weather information for that location. For instance, if you run:

```
node app Kanpur
```

The app will display the following output:

```
Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh
Thundery outbreaks possible. It is currently 90 degrees out. It feels like 102 degrees out.
```

The displayed information will include the location name, state, weather condition, current temperature, and the "feels like" temperature.

## Important Note

Please ensure that your device is connected to the internet while running the app, as it requires an internet connection to fetch real-time weather data.

Feel free to explore the code and make any modifications or improvements as needed. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, don't hesitate to report them in the repository's issue section.

Happy weather tracking!
